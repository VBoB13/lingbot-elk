# ELK Service

This is a containerized version of the ELK service intended as a searching tool for Riversoft's different services.

## Setup

1. Download the project with `git clone` or `git pull`.
2. Launch it with Docker: `sudo docker-compose up -d`
3. View the endpoints as well as each payload schema through this URL: `<server_URL>:8888/docs`
4. The ELK service is not secured, thus no API key needed. This document will be updated once that is necessary.
