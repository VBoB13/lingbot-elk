"Thought Leadership, Frameworks, Tools and Immersion: Interview with Dr Prem Shamdasani of NUS Business School.A tough future in which the only constant is change awaits those who aspire to leadership in the world of business. To prepare these leaders in the making requires a special kind of training. Dr Prem Shamdasani of NUS Business School believes that the institution’s Executive MBA provides students with just such an education, and here he tells us why."
"Good day, Mr Shamdasani! Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to speak with us. Perhaps we can start with you sharing a few words to give us a sense of NUS Business School as an institution, as the banner behind you describes it as “APAC’s most established Executive MBA”."
"For over 50 years, I’m proud to say that NUS Business School has a proven track record of successfully developing leaders and has consistently offered rigorous, relevant, and rewarding business education to outstanding participants across the globe."
"Our NUS Executive MBA is distinctive for offering the best global business knowledge with deep Asian insights, preparing participants to lead Asian businesses to international success and helping global businesses succeed in Asia. We happen to be celebrating our 25th anniversary this year, a milestone event we’re incredibly proud of."
"The NUS Business School and NUS EMBA experience is ranked among the best in Asia and Asia Pacific. What makes the programme truly special? This is the Asian century, and about 60 percent of global GDP will come from the Asia-Pacific. I genuinely believe that, as a programme, we have consistently delivered on our brand promise of a rigorous global EMBA programme, and our Asian focus within a global framework is how we can differentiate our programme from other MBA programmes. "
"With a strong focus on providing thought leadership, frameworks and tools, business insights, and experiential and immersive learning experiences in Asia-Pacific, participants can expect a rich array of content, including case studies, guest speakers, and company visits to key destinations around the region."
"Having spent more than 50 per cent of their time outside of Singapore, participants will leave with the proper knowledge, competencies, and networks to lead both global and Asian organisations to compete effectively in Asia and globally. So, whether you see your future as a professional or an entrepreneur, if it’s in Asia, this is an excellent programme for you."
"Participants of the NUS EMBA programme come from a diverse range of backgrounds, from across the region. Can you tell us more about the diversity you see in the classroom, and how this enriches the learning experience? The NUS Executive MBA takes our participants on this immersive learning experience, through what we call residential segments, to eight cities in seven countries, and in doing so we’re able to provide participants with deep exposure across Asia-Pacific."
"With each cohort, we would like to see diversity in all aspects. We look at cultural, professional, and geographical diversity. We also look at the experience profile of the executives and how they will be able to contribute to the class."
"Because we often encourage peer learning and peer sharing, I find that leveraging almost 800 years of experience per cohort and having a diverse, experienced class adds richness to the conversations and overall learning experience for the participants. This approach allows them to enhance their ability to successfully lead people, teams, and organisations with the myriad perspectives of business and culture they have gained from fellow participants."
"The NUS Executive MBA is the only programme that comprises immersive learning experiences across seven APAC countries. What do you mean by “immersive”? When we designed this programme, we thought to ourselves that one cannot learn about doing business, for example, in Vietnam, from books and a remote classroom in Singapore. "
"We wanted to create an immersive learning environment. The NUS Executive MBA takes our participants on this immersive learning experience, through what we call residential segments, to eight cities in seven countries, and in doing so we’re able to provide participants with deep exposure across Asia-Pacific."
"These residential segments help equip participants with first-hand perspectives into the varied cultural, business, and political landscapes across Asia-Pacific. They typically attend lectures and presentations, participate in lively discussions and debates, visit local and international companies, and meet with business and thought leaders."
"Spending time in these destinations complements and provides local context, relevance, and a feel for the nuances of doing business in these respective countries, giving participants a deeper understanding of the business operations and best practices within that market. We find that this enhances the overall learning experience, allowing them to deepen their appreciation of the specificities and complexities of doing business in each country."
"And I’ve personally noticed that networking and bonding happen much more extensively. When students are out in different destinations, learning, networking together and even partying together, it helps to create that sense of camaraderie and to build close bonds and friendships that last for a long time."
"You talk about discovery and opening the students’ eyes, whether it’s to different cultures or ways of doing business. Alongside those “hard skills”, the technical skills embedded in that core curriculum, how does the NUS Executive MBA journey teach the soft skills of leadership that will then serve them well in the next steps of their career?"
"There are various ways that participants can develop their leadership skills on the EMBA: project work, group discussions, and peer-to-peer learning, for example, can provide opportunities for participants to learn how to work with individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. "
Company visits and dialogue sessions with industry leaders can also provide participants with a deeper understanding on the types of leadership skills required of business leaders today across a variety of functions and industries.
"You have also taught for many years, with your present role as Executive MBA Academic Director. Since you have encountered many students, what is your opinion of today’s EMBA students? How has the educational process and motivation changed over the years?"
"Global business perspectives and processes have changed drastically over the last few years. Thanks to the significant disruptions the world has experienced, the senior executives who take our programme are more resilient than ever. With every passing cohort, I see more and more individuals with the hunger for knowledge that falls far beyond their industries."
"They seem to be more open to alternative concepts, perspectives, and ideas that will help their companies and organisations be future-ready. Paired with the skills acquired through our programme, their open-mindedness and that willingness to pivot will help them become even better, influential leaders. Seeing our graduates soar in their professional careers and other new businesses is hugely gratifying."
What leadership attributes and skills do you see as being the most needed in a post-pandemic world? How does the NUS EMBA equip them? Our commitment to providing that Asian context and focus through networking and immersive learning has remained consistent and true to our proposition.
"The future is going to be a lot tougher. Navigating the VUCAH world and managing increasing risks of disruption brought about by technology, climate, supply chains, geopolitics, cyber, and talent requires today’s leaders to lead with purpose, strategic vision, agility, and speed. Joining the NUS EMBA enables leaders to transform and reinvent themselves and their organisations for long-term growth and sustainability."
"Aside from moving on in their careers and growing and pivoting their businesses for success, I am always very gratified and proud to see our alumni give back to the programme and the school in terms of sharing experiences, guest speaking, and providing internships and scholarships."
"How do you think the programme will continue to evolve in the next five years to adapt and respond to what both students and the market are looking for? Since welcoming our first participants in 1997, this programme has grown from strength to strength, providing unrivalled exposure and immersion in the emerging and powerhouse economies across the Asia Pacific region. "
"The world is constantly changing. Therefore, we must keep our finger on the pulse and move with significant shifts and trends happening in APAC. The University does a great job of keeping up with new business trends and knowledge. It shows how business needs are constantly evolving and how important it is to keep oneself up to date continually."
"Dr Prem Shamdasani is Associate Professor of Marketing; Academic Director, NUS Executive MBA Program; Co-Director, Stanford-NUS International Management Program; Director, and the NUS Marketing Strategy In A Digital World Program at the NUS Business School, National University of Singapore."
"He holds a BBA degree with first class honours from the National University of Singapore (1984) and received his PhD in Marketing from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles (1990). His research and teaching interests include marketing strategy, brand management, customer-centricity and relationship management."
"Aside from teaching graduate and executive MBA courses, Dr Shamdasani is active in consulting, executive development, and training and has worked with over 120 companies globally, such as Abbot, Gucci, McDonalds, Samsung, Microsoft, 3M, Philips, Bayer Healthcare, GSK, Barclays, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, Nestle, Volvo and Ikea."
"Training Future Leaders Through a Transformational Educational Experience.Interview with Dr Gary Stockport, Dean EMBA & Professor of Strategy"
"The world of business education is an intensely competitive one, and executives looking to enhance their career prospects through appropriate training have a wide range of options. Here, Dr Gary Stockport of SP Jain School of Global Management outlines the school’s offering and gives an insight into its aim of delivering an innovative, principled business education."
"Lovely to meet you, Dr Stockport! You had an impressive academic career before becoming the Dean of the EMBA and Professor of Strategy at SP Jain School of Global Management. What is your vision and strategy for the university during this challenging time?"
"Lovely to meet you too! The Vision of SP Jain School of Global Management (SPJ) is, and I quote: “To be an influential, futuristic international business and technology higher education institution recognised for leading innovative, principled education and applied research”. "
"In short, SPJ wants to be at the forefront of management education and strategically intends to be an innovative first mover, whether this applies to global strategy, curriculum design, or using leading-edge technology to enrich the student experience, etc."
"Our school brand’s reputation is “wrapped” around this. Our EMBA “dovetails” into the school’s vision. For example, we continually innovate within the EMBA to strategically position it as one of the best EMBA programmes in the world. We also believe in CANI – constant and never-ending improvement. Sometimes, big changes can be made through the implementation of small incremental changes over time."
"As one of India’s leading management schools, SP Jain takes pride in being a driver of a personal transformation journey of self-discovery. How would you sum up the “essence” of the institution and what makes it worthy of being number 12 in the Forbes List?"
"We are an institution that prides itself in being at the leading edge of management theory and practice. We have faculty who are world-class teachers and bring many years of applied work experience into the classroom. SPJ faculty have also published in high-quality academic journals, as well as more practitioner-oriented research outputs. In short, our faculty represents a dynamic capability which has built a distinct strategic difference for our school. This is the “essence” of the school."
"SP Jain’s Executive MBA (EMBA), in particular, is a carefully crafted balance of theoretical and practical application of knowledge, with flexibility built into the design. What can participants expect from this course?"
Participants can expect a truly transformational experience where they will become better general managers as well as future leaders. SPJ offers a very rich programme of learning that assists career acceleration and adaptation. 
"The EMBA is coherently designed within a number of terms which are structured as follows: The Fundamentals of Managing; Becoming a Senior Leader; Being a Leader; Specialisations – Electives, in the areas of marketing, finance, operations and entrepreneurship. "
"The programme culminates in students undertaking an applied strategy project which investigates a real business issue with proposed solutions for their employer. Many of the projects undertaken have proved to be of major strategic significance, for example the identification of a new product or service to help strategically position the organisation for the future."
"SP Jain has become widely known for its inspiring global faculty. Could you share some insights about that, and how it leads to a more diverse experience for the students?"
"As mentioned earlier, SPJ prides itself on the quality of its staff. As the school has campuses based in Dubai, Singapore, Mumbai, and Sydney, the global diversity of staff is ensured. EMBA assistant deans hail from Canada, Switzerland, and India, and bring a global perspective to strategic thinking with regard to the EMBA."
"If I can humbly talk about myself as a specific example, I have lived and worked in the UK, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Australia (again), and the UAE, in that order. I have also consulted with over 200 private and public sector global organisations. In sum, all this enables SPJ to provide a truly global and real-world rich learning experience, which perhaps other institutions cannot readily imitate."
"Talking of students, we have also learned that SP Jain has a very strong student and alumni network. How has the school managed to knit such a strong connection with everyone, and do you often organise events to promote this and keep it going?"
"Our ELO technology platform mimics everything within a physical learning classroom along with having a global reach; indeed, we have students from 20+ countries attending our Global OL EMBA.We regularly hold networking events where current EMBA students can network with alumni. "
"These events are held both face to face and online. A recent EMBA event held in Singapore attracted some 130+ people. Therefore, current students can find out about from alumni the “fruits” of their 18-month strategic investment, including some quantitative measures about career acceleration and adaptation. Examples have included EMBA alumni who have switched careers, such as from a corporate career to starting their own business. This is quite common."
"Can you tell us more about the Engaged Learning Online (ELO) technology that powers your EMBA programme? Our ELO technology platform mimics everything within a physical learning classroom along with having a global reach; indeed, we have students from 20+ countries attending our Global OL EMBA. "
"This includes facilitated faculty discussion in real time, speaking, and chat using group break-out rooms. The technology is now so specific and sophisticated that you can literally see the “whites of a student’s eyes” on the screen. Students’ visual reactions to, say, questions can be clearly seen and monitored by faculty. Personally, I love teaching via a traditional classroom and through ELO."
How important do you think it is to familiarise yourself with the latest technologies in the world? What are your thoughts on artificial intelligence and metaverse? Do you think their impact will grow to different heights or eventually die down?
"Students need to be aware of the latest developments, whether AI, machine learning, the Internet-of-Things, or disruptive business models, etc. All these are interwoven throughout the curriculum. This is done through analysing case studies, simulations, and bringing authoritative guest speakers into the classroom."
"More than ever, corporations are valued for their contributions to social development and global sustainability. What is SP Jain’s strategy to produce the socially responsible leaders and managers of tomorrow that global corporations need?"
"Courses run at SP Jain EMBA specifically cover topics such as corporate governance and ethics. We recognise the need to build authentic leaders who are aware of how their decisions and actions impact upon many stakeholders, both positively and negatively. Our EMBA specifically considers climate change and the circular economy."
"Up-to-date ethical issues such as the recent case of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos are considered. This story is about a blood-testing product which never worked, but the company’s value “ballooned” to some US$9bn, of which Elizabeth Holmes was worth US$4.5bn, before it then “nose-dived” to literally zero. She has recently been convicted on three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud, and is currently awaiting sentencing."
"What would you say has been the most important element in your messaging for your future global leaders? Global leaders are not born, but made, and doing an EMBA will significantly help (along the way). Global leaders need to have a bundle of capabilities, such as strategic thinking, critical thinking, and the ability to implement with speed, agility, and flexibility."
"This includes the on-going capacity to value-add for their current and future employers. Soft skills, for example the ability to present with confidence and negotiate effectively, etc., are also fundamentally important. SPJ offers a soft-skills learning framework through what it calls its ECAP (Executive Career Accelerated Program)."
"Broadly, ECAP is divided into a number of key components: one-on-one coaching (for example, feedback on CV and LinkedIn profile), masterclass sessions delivered by C-suite executives, toastmaster club, and alumni sessions."
"The university was reported to have around a 300 per cent enrolment growth amid and post pandemic. How would you characterise your experience during the pandemic? What challenges did you face as a global institution with overseas campuses, and what opportunities emerged as a result?"
"The worst of times can also bring out the best of opportunities. Like other institutions, COVID-19 brought very many on-going challenges to SP Jain, with individual campuses having to close, reopen, and then close again. Furthermore, teaching delivery moved from face to face to online. "
"However, within this complex and fast-changing environment, the school was able to seize on the strategic investment it had made in ELO technology a year before COVID-19. We were therefore ideally placed for online delivery. "
"We do not consider this to be luck, but rather good strategic judgement. SPJ had always felt that the future would likely become a blended mixture of face to face and online, but the question was always when, and what might be the ideal combination. “The jury is still out” on this one."
"Why do you think more businesses are looking to upskill their employees through executive education, particularly? Businesses appreciate the impact such training can have immediately back at the workplace."
"In fact, SPJ has been significantly increasing its offering in the executive-education (Ex-Ed) market space over the past two years. This includes open Ex-Ed programmes, as well as customised Ex-Ed programmes, and the school has been developing an enviable reputation within this area. Clearly, there are synergies with this development and the EMBA. For example, a participant “tastes” an Ex-Ed programme and then wants to develop themselves further through undertaking a part-time EMBA."
"SP Jain has many alumni in senior positions. What, according to you, is something that sets them apart from other colleges? Many SP Jain alumni appreciate the quality of learning they have had when studying and wish to give back to the institution as a consequence."
Alumni effectively showcase our brand. They have had a “holistic” professional and personal development through undertaking the EMBA and acquired the confidence to make important strategic decisions combined with the ability to implement efficiently and effectively.
"Globalisation has opened the doors for institutions of higher learning to build strong international networks and create opportunities to bridge continents in collaborative research and other global outreach programmes. You have campuses in Sydney, Mumbai, Singapore, and Dubai. How would you describe SP Jain’s global footprint today and what are your international ambitions for the future?"
"SPJ already has a well-established global footprint and a recognised global brand name through its Dubai, Singapore, Mumbai, and Sydney campuses. These cities are also important global financial hubs. The school is now harnessing its world-class leading-edge technology to roll out its global presence even further. While other Institutions were struggling during COVID-19, the SPJ EMBA became stronger and stronger. We now have students doing our part-time EMBA from over 20 countries."
You’ve mentioned that “India will be one of the global growth engine countries of the world over the next 30 years”. What about the region makes investment – in education or otherwise – appealing? I believe India will become a global growth engine over the next decade. I can certainly see this from my 20 or so trips to India over the past six years.
"I know very well that EMBA students from India particularly value a comprehensive and challenging EMBA programme and curriculum. They want value for money from the strategic investment they make in their EMBA studies, given the money, time, and trade-offs required. Generally, they are hardworking and appreciative of receiving a world-class student experience."
"As the Dean of SP Jain School of Global Management, how would you infuse tomorrow’s leadership with meaning? I think leadership capability is developed through continual practice, day in, day out. In my view, as mentioned earlier, leaders are not born, but rather made through constant development."
"The SPJ EMBA gives students the knowledge, skills, and capabilities to become better general managers, as well as more effective future leaders. I believe the best way for me to emphasise this is through “showcasing” my own leadership capability, as I also have an MBA. Doing an MBA was the best strategic investment I have ever made. I try to do this through my actions each and every day and thus hopefully become a strategic leader role model for others to follow. "
"It’s all about demonstrating experience, wisdom, and courage. There is never one right answer when we face a strategic dilemma and it’s all about making good strategic decisions based upon sound judgement. In reality, this is easier said than done. However, I feel sure that people who have an SPJ EMBA will dramatically increase the probability of a much better outcome, compared with not having one. "

He currently sits as the Dean Executive MBA & Professor Strategy at SP Jain School of Global Management, Dubai, UAE. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at Cranfield School of Management, UK and MBA at University of Warwick, UK.

"Driving Success Through Collaboration and Partnership.“The programme teaches you not just theoretical concepts and business models, but also how to benchmark yourself against others and apply your personal learning experiences, which is absolutely fundamental in the progression and development of a person.” Alessandra Del Centina, Principal Consultant at Vendigital"
"Having already seen significant success in her career from an early stage, Alessandra Del Centina, Principal Consultant at Vendigital, was keen to explore new opportunities to accelerate to a more senior level within her organisation and open up new challenges."
"“After graduating in Management Engineering in Milan, I moved to the UK and worked on a graduate scheme supporting the different functions and departments across a business,” she says. “I realised very early on that I really enjoyed the variety of working on different projects and with different clients and so, took on a role as a Principal Consultant at managing consultants, Vendigital. "
"It’s been a really fantastic opportunity to work across different sectors and companies, helping clients to rebuild their business models post-pandemic.” “I’ve now come to a point in my career where I want to accelerate my success, expand my network and learn from others, surrounded by the best lecturers, support and opportunities that I can.”"
"Alessandra joined the Bath Executive MBA programme in 2021 with the support of her employer. “Having a background in engineering and business meant that a lot of the theoretical concepts are already known to me, but I was keen to revisit them as a professional and explore how different the experiences would be from my undergraduate studies,” she explained."
"“As a management consultancy firm, we sell expertise, professionalism and skill, so the human element and the cultivation of talent is really important. I had seen colleagues grow and develop whilst they were completing their MBA so I was in a privileged position and could already see the benefits.”"
"Vendigital have been working with the MBA team at the University of Bath for almost 4 years. In that time, they have worked collaboratively to help identify and nurture potential candidates for the part-time Executive MBA programme, with the aim of developing talented colleagues with the right skills and knowledge to take the next step in their career ladder."
"Anita Maguire, People Director at Vendigital, explained the strategic thinking behind their partnership with the University of Bath, “We were first introduced to the Bath MBA through the University’s graduate placement programme. It showed us the quality of graduates that come out of Bath and so we wanted to explore further how we could use this to develop our people, progress their careers and ultimately, deliver to our clients.”"
"“When thinking about succession planning, we consider how we equip our colleagues to reach their full potential and support their ambition to progress their career and move into bigger roles in the Vendigital team. We are always looking across our teams to identify motivated and passionate candidates who we think would benefit from an MBA."
"We quickly realised that there is a large appetite for it across our teams that was going to be of benefit to the organisation, but also to each of them as individuals.”Anita stressed that there was more than simply good people development practice on the criteria list when looking for opportunities to develop their future leadership teams. "
“Have we seen a commercial benefit to our investment and partnership with Bath? Absolutely. We have seen a huge difference in every team member as they have progressed through the Bath MBA program. All of the students that we have sponsored have progressed in seniority levels.”
"“Vendigital are expecting to grow by 30-40% this year alone and we see the MBA executive programme as a key enabler of developing our team and the leadership team of tomorrow. The impacts have been far-reaching, providing us with a competitive advantage and level of credibility that allows us to compete with the big consultancies.”"
"Alessandra recognises the impact the course has already had on her personal strategic development, and how she applies this to her role at Vendigital. “The programme teaches you not just theoretical concepts and business models, but also how to benchmark yourself against others and apply your personal learning experiences, which is absolutely fundamental in the progression and development of a person.”"
"“There is this fantastic, immersive learning atmosphere where it is safe to challenge one another and be really open and honest about some of the things that we can do better as professionals but also for our organisations,” she explains. "
“The modules and assignments encourage a strategic frame of mind and constantly challenge you to consider the bigger picture of why are we doing this and what are we trying to achieve? You can then apply this to your work and make changes that have huge impact and make you so much more effective in the workplace.”
"Anita’s advice for anyone considering an MBA partnership for their employees? “If you are serious about succession planning and how best to develop your teams, do speak with the MBA recruitment team at the University of Bath. They are incredibly knowledgeable about the programme, the content, the type of individual that it would really benefit but also how to make it work for your organisation so that you get the most out of your investment.”"
“We’ll absolutely continue our partnership with the MBA at Bath to help drive our business forwards.” Visit The Bath MBA for more information or contact Becky Gallagher at mbaapps@management.bath.ac.uk
"Lifelong Learning with ESSEC Business School.The demand for new approaches to learning has been on a steady rise after the tumultuous past few years.

"Top Executive Education featuring Antwerp Management School: Opening Minds to Impact the World.Interview with Antwerp Management School‘s Prof. Dr. Goran Milenković, Academic Director of the EMBA and Prof. Dr. Steffi Weil, Associate Dean for International Outreach & Academic Director (and Professor)"
"Today’s business world is a complex, difficult-to-understand space for executives. It’s reasonable to suppose that good preparation for functioning effectively in such an environment might involve first understanding oneself. Here, Professors Goran Milenković and Steffi Weil of Antwerp Management School explain how the school’s PhD and EMBA programmes place an emphasis on personal development."
"Good day, Professor Milenković and Professor Weil! Thank you for lending us your time and it’s a pleasure to speak with you both. How has the new year been treating you so far?"
"PROF. DR. GORAN MILENKOVIĆ: Like all international business schools, we have entered the new year with challenges due to COVID. Nevertheless, our intake numbers look good, and our operations teams, faculty, and international partners are ensuring continued delivery of onshore and offshore modules. "
"PROF. DR. GORAN MILENKOVIĆ: As we speak, our EMBA team is making final preparations for participants to visit MIT in the USA in January, and the American University in Cairo in February. Our intake in Moscow is also doing well and we have just recently launched our programme in Paris. For the latter two, we are very grateful to our local partners IBS/Ranepa in Russia and ESSCA School of Management in France. "
PROF. DR. STEFFI WEIL: Thank you very much for this question. The year has started off very well. We have a lot of interesting projects in the pipeline and we have two PhD defences in January. This energises me a lot.
"For 60 years and counting, Antwerp Management School has looked beyond the mere transfer of technical knowledge and imparted generations’ worth of leadership wisdom. What would you say are the cornerstones of the university’s teaching philosophy?"
"GM: Our motto, “Opening Minds to Impact the World”, has influenced our approach to knowledge transfer since the very beginning. As a management school, we try to nurture future leaders in both industry and the social enterprise sector. We don’t subscribe to any one individual economic or social theory. We pass on the multitude of conceptual options and views about management challenges and allow participants to make their own choices."
"The AMS approach prides itself on simplicity: the better you feel as a person, the more confident you are when dealing with complicated business situations. How important is a healthy self-image when it comes to being a leader?"
"As a management school, we try to nurture future leaders in both industry and the social enterprise sector. We don’t subscribe to any one individual economic or social theory."
"SW: This is an interesting question and certainly made me reflect. I am not an expert in healthy self-image but I luckily work for an organisation that puts a lot of emphasis on a healthy working environment. Healthy in the sense that we can identify with our work, that we enjoy what we are doing and that we can address issues that might become challenging."
"I think this kind of open working environment also has a positive impact on self-image and on leadership. To be able to discuss, reflect and brainstorm helps me to develop a positive self-image. To be able to “be who you are” makes for a good leader. A good leader is certainly not a perfect leader, but an environment which allows for mistakes and critical reflection creates good leaders."
"Antwerp Management School is the only Belgian business school to be included in the FT’s Top 100 list of Executive MBAs, consequently earning you the top spot in all of Benelux. How does it feel to gain all this recognition?"
"GM: Of course, it’s a great honour. We are a medium-sized business school, and the Benelux is a small geographic space. To be recognised on a par with, or even better than other global institutions is flattering. Overall, we are ranked number 45 in the group of global EMBAs, but on our specialities, such as international diversity or ESG/CSR, we score in the top quintile."
Executives who have successfully completed the EMBA programme describe it as “transformative” and “career-changing”. Do you recall a particular student’s success story or the career paths of some of your participants?
GM: Our participants are typically 35-45 years old. They are mature individuals with 15-plus years of practical experience. All are professionally successful. Deciding to do a degree programme at that stage of one’s life means that it is not just about acquiring additional knowledge. There is also an inner need to better understand oneself in order to correctly shape the next stages of one’s career. That is why our programme includes an extensive personal development portfolio.
"In addition to the usual array of psychometric tests and individual coaching that are quite common nowadays, we are fortunate to have our own NeuroTraining Lab. For example, our participants don’t just discuss the links between personality types and leadership styles. In our lab, they observe their own brain activity and recognise the influence of their own subconscious reactions in different situations, such as stress, conflict, and so on."
"This combination of soft and hard insights really improves personal effectiveness and communication. For many, it is a real eye-opener and helps clarify personal ambitions and understanding of themselves. In our last survey, 78 per cent of participants said that they had achieved their goals for doing an EMBA within three years of graduation."
"With AMS now holding the highest ranking ever achieved by a Belgian business school with its EMBA, what would you say are the programme’s unique features and highlights? The Positive Impact Project, for example, is a unique way of stimulating global challenges."
"GM: Besides the core subjects present in all EMBA programmes, such as strategy, leadership, finance, and so on, we pay special attention to the transitional challenges of global business, including environmental, societal, and governance issues. The latter is not positioned as a corporate responsibility, but rather as a deeply personal one. Future-oriented managers understand that responsible leadership is as much about ESG-related actions as it is about consistent behaviour. "
"Our programme has ESG elements incorporated in every course and, on top of that, we ask our participants to do a hands-on Positive Impact Project. We are inspired by the notion that business and sustainability are not conflicting viewpoints. Rather, the world is still discovering how to combine the two. In total, we devote about 150 teaching hours to ESG-related topics and about 80 hours on fieldwork."
"Some participants focus on their local communities or their workplace. Others have crossed borders and even continents. We had participants working on initiatives reducing poverty, supporting the development of alternative energy sources, working in prisons, building schools, changing agroforestry, tutoring children, or assisting single parents. "
"This is not charity work. It pushes every student to seriously go outside their comfort zone, but use their talents, management experience, and knowledge to find opportunities to bring business and ESG closer together. Every project proposal is carefully reviewed and finally evaluated by a mixed panel. And the emphasis is always on ensuring both short-term and long-term impact. "
"Aside from its Executive MBA programmes, AMS also offers a PhD programme for executives? Professor Weil, in your role as academic director of the PhD programme, can you explain the programme to us? We see a senior leading position as an enabler to conduct research, to publish and to successfully graduate with a PhD degree. We have witnessed that a structured curriculum that educates our candidates in research and writing skills leads to success."
"SW: Yes, of course, with pleasure. I love talking about the PhD programme, because it gives me so much joy to witness how our PhD candidates engage in this life-changing project with us. But first things first – what is the PhD programme for executives? It is a four-year programme that supports and guides executives/managers to obtain a PhD degree. A PhD degree is a doctoral degree, the highest academic title one can receive."
Our programme runs in close collaboration with the University of Antwerp. This means that our PhD candidates enjoy the full service of Antwerp Management School while being able to receive a fully fledged PhD degree from the University of Antwerp. To obtain a PhD is a life-changing experience and we are very proud to offer a programme to senior executives who aim to fulfil their dream with us. 
"Our program is tailor-made around their needs. To hold an executive position in industry is challenging and to write a PhD alongside it is even more challenging. We aimed to turn this challenge into a opportunity. We see a senior leading position as an enabler to conduct research, to publish and to successfully graduate with a PhD degree. "
"We have witnessed that a structured curriculum that educates our candidates in research and writing skills leads to success. The programme is now running in its fifth year and we can honestly say that our bespoke programme really works. We are immensely proud to call our graduates from all over the world “Doctor”! The degree itself, of course, opens new doors, not only intellectually but also career-wise and on a personal level."
To be able to celebrate these successes with our candidates and to have the honour to get to know them personally during the four-year journey gives me a lot of positive energy. I am also lucky to be surrounded by a strong team that supports the candidates during this exciting PhD journey. 
"Professor Milenković, you’ve mentioned that in order to fully step into a leadership position, you may need to lose attachment with certain functions of the model to welcome a broader sense of understanding the bigger picture. For people intimidated by the volume of knowledge needed to start a business, how would you encourage them to take that leap of faith? "
GM: An EMBA is a “generalist” programme and designed for professionals wanting to move beyond the confines of a single function or specialised occupation. Moving out of the “cosiness” of being an expert in a particular domain to becoming a general manager can be daunting. But that does not mean that everyone needs to be an expert in everything. 
"The EMBA gives one the tools to analyse and rationalise, to understand the jargon of multiple functions, and to know what to ask if you don’t understand something. All general managers go through this “functional detachment” process. And an EMBA is the quickest way to learn how to do it."
"What are the principal benefits that executive education has to offer in the post-COVID environment? GM: COVID has brought a massive change to the way business is done, the way customers behave, and the way managers need to lead. I like to compare it to league football. We had sunshine for a while and now, due to the pandemic, it is raining continuously.The fact that it is raining does not mean we stop training or playing football. "
"We must adapt how we train and what skills we train for. We already see that what is considered “good leadership practice” is different when you cannot meet your colleagues face-to-face. For example, our experience confirms that informal leaders in virtual teams are elevated to that position not by demonstrating traits of “a good leader prototype”, such as charisma, but rather by helping the dispersed team to be efficient and being a worker bee themselves. "
"We also see that company cultures are changing. I live in Germany and, two years ago, you needed written permission to work from home. Now you must get permission to come to the office. In that situation, how does one pass on a company culture or work ethic, which is often instilled by replications, to new recruits who have never seen a colleague at work? There are answers. But they are different from what we have been teaching during the BC (“before COVID”) era. "
"Professor Weil, as an expert in Global Political Economy it must be difficult to witness how the global arena has changed. As Academic Director of the China-Europe Business Master, would you be able to share your perspective on the current global political economy?"
"SW: Yes indeed it is difficult to witness how political and economic protectionist behaviour is rising. It is especially sad to watch how China has closed its borders to the outside world. This has implications not only for global supply chains but also for global politics. China remains a strong global player, an important stakeholder for international investments and global politics. "
"The international community aims to have a two-tier approach: to remain open to China as a global economic actor, while addressing sensitive political issues in a relatively open manner. Yet, if I am very honest from an academic perspective, the current situation allows me to address very interesting research topics. We have learned that we cannot take liberalism or even democratic rights for granted. "
"We should remain critical and learn how to ask different questions. We also address the new challenges and questions in our programmes. We have integrated new exciting topics on supply chain, global trade and the role of multiple international stakeholders into our lectures. It is exciting to discuss new questions that arise with our students and executive candidates.  "
What are the biggest challenges you have encountered in handling multicultural groups and addressing the varying needs of business leaders across different industries? How do you overcome them?
"GM: Our typical cohort is very mixed. We have on average 15-20 nationalities, with people coming from 20-30 industries. Around 40 per cent are women. This is a wonderful opportunity to listen to each other and discover each other’s views and experiences. I really believe that about half of the knowledge gained during our programme comes from participant interaction and learning from each other. "
"Of course, we also have interesting discussions outside the classroom, especially during or after joint dinners. Views are many and widely varied. In addition, we spend about 20-25 days abroad during study visits to top academic institutions in Asia, Europe, the USA, and Africa. While there, our students have joint sessions with EMBA counterparts and experience teaching styles different from ours."
"This creates a wonderful and, I would even say, sparkling learning environment. But overall, I’m always pleasantly surprised how relationships grow over time and how people from different backgrounds and cultures are brought together through learning and, by graduation time, start treating each other not as colleagues but as members of an extended family."
"In our Global Leadership Skills track, we work with our students on self-awareness, on how to become global leaders and global citizens, and societal consciousness. In COVID times, skills like this are particularly helpful and crucial."
"SW: That is a very good question. In the executive PhD programme, there are lesser challenges, because the research of our candidates benefits from different perspectives and cultures. A number of our PhD candidates even conduct research on multicultural aspects. Yet, of course, there are challenges when working in a very international environment such as ours. "
"We have students from all over the world. We are very much aware of this and we educate our students and staff on multicultural differences. In our Global Leadership Skills track, we work with our students on self-awareness, on how to become global leaders and global citizens, and societal consciousness. In COVID times, skills like this are particularly helpful and crucial. "
"The biggest challenge was when the students enjoyed their semester in China when the Chinese government decided to lock down the country. Thanks to our international network and our strong coaching and Global Leadership Skills team, we were able to bridge cultural differences even during this constraining period."
The students grew stronger as a team. There was great mutual understanding in a situation where students from multiple backgrounds were locked up together in student housing. 
"It takes a certain level of commitment to pursue a postgraduate degree. How do you make sure that the participants and their organisations gain the highest return on their investment in terms of knowledge acquisition, career advancement, long-term profitability for the business, and other measures of ROI for executive education?"
"GM: There is no way around it – doing an EMBA is a serious investment, in both time and money. The ROI should exceed the total opportunity cost. We strongly encourage all students to make every effort and to use assignments and projects to solve their own company-related challenges. At the same time, we take a holistic view to ROI; that is, we value equally monetary and non-monetary returns. "
"Of course, it is not easy to measure non-financial impact. We find that the best indicator of a positive ROI is word-of-mouth recommendations by employers. We are very happy with the fact that over 80 per cent of our participants have partial or full employer backing, when it comes to fees and study time. So, obviously, employers do see a positive ROI."
"As the Academic Director of Antwerp Management School’s EMBA, what do you find the most exciting when it comes to nurturing the mind of an eager student? GM: For me personally, the biggest reward is the “twinkle in the eye” of a student that I see when a discussion or comment has made them think about a topic in a way other than what they are used to."
"What will future participants in the EMBA programme be most interested in learning from it, in order to prepare them for this new world? GM: The world is ever-changing. The role of leaders is ever-changing. I’m a great believer in William Gibson’s adage that the future is already here, but that it’s unevenly distributed. We hope that our EMBA programme will continue to bring  some of that future to our participants in more ways than one."
"What can we expect to see from Antwerp Management School in 2022? GM: For our EMBA programme, the biggest addition will be the start of a fully fledged cohort in Paris. For our school, however, a big step will be finalising preparations for Triple Crown accreditation and joining the 1 per cent of business schools that have achieved this distinction."
"SW: A lot of exciting things! In the last two years, we have managed the COVID crisis quite well. This very unique situation also led to more innovation. We are excited to further develop and implement our projects on sustainable transformation and internationalisation. You will see exciting new teaching and learning aspects, more PhD candidates who will graduate, and new hybrid international short programmes where we aim to combine our domestic and international ecosystem and expertise.

"What’s Next for TravelTech? Insights from Riversoft CEO, Alex Kuo.The COVID-19 pandemic has presented, and continues to present, enormous challenges across the spectrum of industry, not least for the travel and tourism sector. One company that is actively developing IT solutions to help travel and tourism operators survive and even prosper in these difficult times is the Taiwanese software house Riversoft. Chairman and CEO Alex Kuo tells us more."
"It’s lovely to meet you, Mr Kuo! Thank you very much for sitting down with us today. You had quite a career before focusing on the tourism industry. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your professional journey?"
"Thank you for having me to this interview. I am a lucky man and was brought up in Taiwan. I had a pretty smooth learning path from the best high school and university in Taiwan, and received advanced MBA education from George Washington University in the US. I worked in Acer group for almost 20 years and in two big private, tech-based companies in China for six years. "
"Then, I immigrated to Canada and started my career of venture angel to more than 10 companies. I particularly devoted myself to the travel and travel IT business from 2017. Now, I am concentrating on Riversoft, a travel AI and solution company, and Lotus, a class A travel agency in Taiwan. "
"I am very much enjoying my learning experience from transforming the tourism industry and fighting against the impact of the pandemic to ensure the survival of my company. So far, we are doing well, even though we are still in a stage of the pandemic period."
How did you decide to come back to Taiwan and join Riversoft? Was there a specific moment which influenced you to make this decision?
"I was introduced to assisting a traditional travel agency in Vancouver in 2016. During the survey, I found that the operational logic of making a tour package is very similar to making a computer. Further, the travel business consists of integrating service, content, creativity, and IT technology. This attracts me a lot. Besides, travel is in a global business environment and fits me well, since I spent all my career in Acer working towards globalisation."
"Since 2008, Riversoft has continuously assisted traditional travel agencies in upgrading and optimising their ERP systems and e-commerce websites. Can you walk us through your core services?"
"In the period 2008-18, Riversoft mainly devoted itself to assisting small and medium-sized travel agencies in using the subscription model to make their website and ERP via software as a service. Riversoft received investment from Peakwork and me in 2019, Lion travel in 2022, and Chain4Travel in 2022. I also injected further investment in Riversoft to ensure my confidence in its capability and potential for the future. "
"From 2019, Riversoft built up its core competence in travel, ESG, and blockchain. In the travel sector, we have perfectly integrated Peakwork‘s dynamic packaging engine and Riversoft’s NLP and ERP into different types of services to fit a variety of requirements of the global tourism industry"
You’ve grown the company into a business with multiple international travel partners. Can you tell us a bit more about the strategic thinking behind this? To what can you attribute this level of success?
"Riversoft was originally a local software house to small and medium-sized travel agencies. In order to cultivate its capability and capacity, I invited Peakwork, Lion Travel, and Chain4Travel to invest in Riversoft and infuse financial, technical, and market resources to support the transformation of the company. "
"In addition, we recruited employees from Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, and Sweden. My global working experience and channel networking also supported Riversoft’s entry into the global market"
"In 2019, Riversoft entered a joint venture with Peakwork, a leading travel technology company from Germany, to engage in a strategic cooperation. How has this partnership benefited you today?"
"Yes, Peakwork’s investment has benefited Riversoft in three dimensions.First, Peakwork invested in Riversoft during the pandemic period, and this investment has encouraged the whole team a lot, financially as well as psychologically.Secondly, Peakwork’s technology framework has always guided us with a broader and wider scope of implementation to explore a deeper insight into the travel industry."
"Finally, networking partners from the Peakwork ecosystem have brought a huge business potential to our approach."
How would you define your organisational culture? How have you managed to scale up your team over the years and maintain a coherent culture?
"I want Riversoft to be a place full of technology innovation, cross-border cultural cooperation, and inspiration for well-being. Over the years, we have done our best to grow and educate our employees to learn new technology applications, to contribute to social welfare, and to participate in building ESG-related enterprises. We have continued to perform these activities even during the pandemic period."
"The last two years had the world at a standstill due to COVID-19, with the tourism and hospitality industry being the worst-hit sector. How well do you think Riversoft weathered this crisis?"
"Riversoft has luckily survived throughout the whole pandemic period. From this disaster, we learned how to be resilient in the face of change and grow new capabilities during tough times. Now, we have grown our capability in medical services with our NLP and chatbot technology. This is one of the most valuable lessons learned. We are very proud of our staff for their integrity and loyalty to Riversoft and for assisting the whole company to survive and grow from this crisis."
"Travel patterns have also changed significantly during the pandemic, with customers shifting toward domestic travel or trips to neighbouring countries. What’s your outlook on tourism in the short and long term?"
"Riversoft has luckily survived throughout the whole pandemic period. From this disaster, we learned how to be resilient in the face of change and grow new capabilities during tough times."
"We foresee that tourists will ask for more freedom of choice, more options for small groups, and greater focus on security and insurance. We have already adjusted our technology platform to fit these changes in demand. In the short term, we will concentrate on enhancing our existing networking partnerships with a consensus towards building protocols of cooperation in order to satisfy customer requirements. "
"In the long term, we will adopt more user-friendly technology to support these shifting requirements, such as contactless payment, conversation as a service powered by AI, and remote medical-aid support for tourists."
"Your company is well positioned to enable travellers to search and book on the site almost throughout the travel cycle, from city guides to flights, hotels, tours, and restaurants. What do you see as the most important trends in the world of travel booking?"
"There are three key important trends in travel booking.First, travellers are asking for wider and instant availability of travel resources. Here, we have successfully implemented the best practice of Peakwork from Europe."
"Second, we will use chatbot to support tourists via our NLP AI engine to assist them with their service requirements.Finally, we have successfully engaged with the mobile portal from Payke [1] of SCSK, and the robot concierge from Guardforce AI [2]. This is an innovative pattern in the tourism industry and we expect it to lead to a trendy new service in the near future."
"DART stands for Dynamic Attention Referral Technology. For this, we want to serve tourists with a “what you choose is what you get” service."
You are currently developing an epic new project called DART. Can you tell us a bit more about this new development? What are the objectives and goals of such an innovation?
"DART stands for Dynamic Attention Referral Technology. We invented this technology in order to achieve the following goals.First, we want to serve tourists with a “what you choose is what you get” service. In comparison with many MarTech companies, who carry out a lot of tagging analysis on customer needs, we add more domain knowledge to resource supply, with instant control of availability."
"Second, we have pioneered a cookie-less NLP tagging ontology to understand or even foresee tourists’ service needs.Third, we want to build a customer-centric service platform and support cross-border cooperation between supply chains.These innovations and integrations have become our corporate mission and have driven our technology development."
"What do you think are the biggest challenges that the hospitality and tourism industry will face in the next 10 years in Taiwan and globally?In the coming ten years, Taiwan needs to make its best efforts to transform itself from local tourism-oriented hospitality to at least a regional service and support platform with multi-cultural operation. "
"We expect to phase in new technology and a new business model in Taiwan. As for global concerns, I think net-zero, metaverse, NLP AI, and blockchain will definitely influence the future landscape of global tourism."
"What is next for Riversoft? Can you share with us your planning for 2023? In 2023, our priority of business execution is doing proof of business according to our plans. We expect to develop most of our technology modules by the end of 2022.   Also, we will start to plan for Riversoft‘s long-term capital structure in order to grow in scale and with global expansion."
"And lastly, Mr Kuo, what is success to you?I define my success not from how much money I make or what title I earn from this venture. I consider my task to grow Riversoft into a global arena as my life mission, to show my gratitude for my good fortune in being a Taiwanese and for being raised by my parents. I also feel that this whole experience and achievement will be the best gift I could leave to my family and children. "
"I am very grateful to have this chance and opportunity to contribute my learning from school, from Acer, and from many partners. I will pass on my leadership to my successor, together with my hopes for Riversoft to become a public company in the near future. In the years to come, I hope that Riversoft will go down in Taiwanese history for being a role model in assisting Taiwan’s economic transformation."
"Alex Kuo is the Chairman of Riversoft, a Taiwanese software company focusing on developing innovative solutions and management systems for the travel and tourism industry. Kuo has an MBA from George Washington University and is pursuing an EDBA from Université de Liège. He had over 20 years of career in the Acer group holding senior positions. "
"Before moving to Canada, he worked in two publicly-listed tech-based companies in China for six years. Kuo has also been a venture angel supporting the growth of more than 10 companies globally."
"Payke: High Tech to Enrich the Japan Experience. Payke is an innovative solution for visitors to Japan that uses product translation technology to enrich the tourism experience. Its Travel Support service adds access to travel insurance, portable Wi-Fi, and chat information and advice. Taiwanese tech specialist Riversoft has partnered with Payke creator SCSK to deliver major enhancements to the app, as CEO Alex Kuo explains."
"Hello, Alex. Let’s talk about your recent collaboration with the Japanese tech company SCSK in developing the travel app Payke. Payke is a popular app, currently ranked number one in the app store for Taiwan and Hong Kong, with over 4 million users and growing. Please tell us what type of services and benefits the Payke app offers."
"Payke is an app designed for travellers to Japan, with a unique product translation technology that translates all the details of a product by scanning the barcode and locating many products in Japan. It makes Payke one of the most popular apps for travellers to Japan."
"Payke recently launched Payke Travel Support (PTS) as a travel service, combining insurance, portable Wi-Fi, and concierge service (chat support service). Compared to other travel insurance without coverage for the first day of the traveller’s visit, PTS can activate the day the traveller arrives in Japan. PTS also covers notifiable diseases that other travel insurance does not cover, such as COVID."
"The portable Wi-Fi included in PTS’s services are Vision Inc. devices, which are high-quality, stable and fast-sharing. It is common for people to have multiple 3C products (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) per person. That’s why we choose portable Wi-Fi instead of the e-SIM network."
"Chat service support is SCSK’s speciality. SCSK’s call centre consists of 5,000 employees, supports seven languages (Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai) and assists with restaurant reservations, sightseeing advice, interpretation, and even lost and found items.With these three services included, travellers only need to purchase PTS before their trip and solve most of the problems encountered during their trip."
Riversoft and SCSK have partnered to make the Payke app even more powerful. Can you tell us more about this partnership? What role does Riversoft play?
"By collaborating on Payke, SCSK has integrated many services into a complete tourist service for travellers. Riversoft mainly plays the role of bridging Payke to Lion travel by API. Riversoft also assigns YC Health, its subsidiary, to act as an agent to distribute PTS in Taiwan. YC Health will start to promote PTS from December 2022 and build up a fulfilment centre to enhance customer satisfaction."
" In the near future, YC Health will create a marketing plan with Payke/SCSK to enlarge the market share in Taiwan."
SCSK chose to collaborate with Riversoft over many other IT companies. What do you think is the unique know-how or technical edge that distinguishes Riversoft from the others?
"Riversoft has a powerful booking engine that can categorise and label users based on their behaviour, recommending relevant content to users, extending their time to browse, and increasing their interest and willingness to purchase. The technology can also be applied with CRM included.  Riversoft also uses this technology for social software robots to help travel agencies manage customers and remarketing."
The two technologies are integrated to recommend shopping orders and arrange shopping routes for users. This service can provide a smooth shopping experience.
"Payke has a recommendation function for products with Japanese barcodes, but not for travel products. Therefore, Riversoft will apply this technology to Payke and upgrade Payke’s shopping system to recommend related products according to users’ interests. The two technologies are integrated to recommend shopping orders and arrange shopping routes for users. This service can provide a smooth shopping experience."
"In addition to shopping in Japan, we invite local travel agencies in Taiwan to join this cooperative project.  We plan to build a travel product platform on Payke and include itineraries and tickets from local travel agencies in Taiwan, so travellers can purchase itineraries and tickets directly on the app. In the future, we will further extend our cooperation to flight and accommodation packaged dynamically through joint efforts between the three parties."
"Did you encounter difficulties working with SCSK in adding value to Payke?Riversoft has a comprehensive vertical integration capability, dedicated to tourism for over ten years. With the project with SCSK, the most challenging point is not the interconnection of data and technologies but the conception and development of a complete set of tourism services across Taiwan and Japan. "
"In the Payke app, they already have insurance, Wi-Fi, and call centre services, and we add medical care to provide a second-opinion service for travellers to Japan. On the other hand, we wish to establish the same model for inbound travellers to Taiwan. To Riversoft, the most difficult part is finding a service centre in Taiwan that complies with SCSK’s SLAs. We are now dealing with Lion Travel, Far Eastern Group, Formosa TV, etc., to establish the Payke Taiwan version. "
"What can we expect in the future for Riversoft and Payke? We are ready to start the next phase of cooperation after the launch of PTS. We are also ready to make the products of local travel agencies available on the Payke app, so travellers can purchase itineraries and tickets on the Payke app."
"In the future, we will further invite local travel agencies in Japan to offer their in-depth itineraries, so travellers can have a deeper travel experience. We also plan to design a new process with GFAI Robot Travel Agency to provide a tour service using LBS."
"Other proposals under discussion include the weather recommendation system Netzero to recommend suitable travel dates for travellers, Airline Holiday providing Peakwork’s dynamic packaging system to SCSK’s customers, and Peach Airline for an online Travel Agent service."
"Preserving the Human Element in Robots with Blue Ocean Robotics.Interview with Claus Risager, Blue Ocean Robotics Chief Strategy Officer."
"In the films, robots are often shown as a threat, frequently getting out of control as they seek to dominate the human race. The reality, as Blue Ocean Robotics Chief Strategy Officer Claus Risager outlines, is that the whole point of robots is to bring improvement to the health and quality of life of humans "
"Good day, Mr Risager! It’s lovely to speak with you again and we’re grateful you chose to spend this time with us. How are you liking the new year so far? "
"The new year has started with a number of quite big orders for new customers for all three robots. However, I can’t disclose more about these. The new year has also meant a big change for me personally, as I decided to step down as the CEO and take a new role in the company as the CSO – Chief Strategy Officer. I will remain on the board of directors and the executive board.  "
"You had quite a career before setting up your own company. A lot of technical entrepreneurs go on to study business management to acquire business skills. How did you acquire yours? When I worked for A.P. Moller-Maersk years ago, I enjoyed being part of their leadership education programme, which was a combined practical and theoretical education. "
"You’ve been working with robots since 1988. A generous amount of disruptive technological trends have emerged since then. How have you maintained your interest in robots even after all this time? As part of the Blue Ocean Robotics logo, say “– for humans”. We are really passionate about creating robots that bring value into people’s lives."
"My passion is really when our robots create value for the users in terms of increased productivity, better working environments and users’ health, as well as better quality and quality of life for the users. Effects like this create real value for the users and for their employers – value that can transform lives to be more meaningful, more rewarding and healthier. "
"So, for me, it’s not the technology as such, but more what it can do for humans that motivates me. That’s also why we, as part of the Blue Ocean Robotics logo, say “– for humans”. We are really passionate about creating robots that bring value into people’s lives. "
"Blue Ocean Robotics has successfully carried through the various phases of robotic automation, from idea and design to development and commercialisation. As the CEO, what have you sacrificed to get here? "
"Over the nine years I have been the CEO at Blue Ocean Robotics, I have probably been working 70-80 hours a week on average. I have always prioritised my family and Blue Ocean Robotics at the top, but there has been little time for friends, hobbies and similar. I don’t regret anything – quite the opposite – but clearly I have made some sacrifices here and there."
"Have you had any surprising insights when your robotic systems were deployed? For example, how did the “real world” deployments differ from expectations going in? "
"There are a lot of interesting surprises from the deployment of robots. I think the most important thing is really what it takes to make sure robots of the kinds we are building are well integrated into the customers’ workflows. That takes a lot of effort and much more than you would think. And it is not a one-time activity, it’s ongoing."
Your company aims to “free robots from their safety cages” and let them interact directly with humans to foster a more beneficial relationship. What does that mean in terms of new opportunities for existing robotic installations? 
"Maybe the most interesting thing about making service robots that interact with people and operate in open environments is that the technologies applied are, to a large extent, reusable across a number of different types of robots and that this again opens up the way for many new types of applications and robots to be created in the future. "
"How do you preserve the “human element” in your robots? That’s relatively easy, because all our robots are designed with the single key purpose of being an efficient tool for a user. So everything is centred around what the user is doing today and how the robot can become an efficient tool in the future for the user to have a better work life and do the jobs better. Therefore, the human element is directly embedded and is a core element in our robots. "
Your company obviously solves a real problem by making robots smarter and safer to work with. How long do you think it will be before the next generation of robots is making this “add-on“ obsolete and what would that mean for your business? 
"I don’t see this work as being an “add-on”. I see it more as being necessary in order to make robots so successful that you are able to fit as perfectly with the users, the surroundings and the task at hand as possible, while of course ensuring full safety and reliability. For every type of robot you create, you are going to consider exactly these three elements – users, environments, tasks – in order to succeed with the robots. "
"I don’t think this will ever change, but the tools we use get smarter and smarter, which enables us to make the robots gradually faster, better and more cost-efficient. "
"What’s on the horizon for industrial robotic solutions? Although it’s been a while since I spent much time on industrial robotic solutions, I would still dare to predict that the coming years are really focused on the collaborative robots, but also, in particular, how production workers – not engineers – can easily assemble robotic production cells and integrate all components physically, electrically and software-wise, while still being able to set it up for a specific task to be done. "
"More advanced tools are being developed all the time in this area and this paves the way for more flexible or even adaptive manufacturing, while still achieving a high degree of productivity and efficiency. At the same time we are also overcoming an increasing problem of shortage of human resources and, in particular, of people with skills at engineer level. "
"Healthcare has never been more crucial than it is now. Hospitals have to look at the overall costs of treatment, reducing the length of hospital stays, and reduction in complications as the major selling points for robotic technologies. What can be done to reduce the cost per operation of using robotics? The fact that our robots save lives every day and make life so much easier for so many people is really motivating for the Blue Ocean Robotics team."
"One good example is our UVD Robot. which disinfects, for example, operating theatres and reduces the spread of infections. Most people do not know that every time 16 patients come to the hospital, one of them acquires an infection there and, on average, spends another nine days at the hospital being treated. "
"This is extremely costly and often painful for the patients. In fact, more than 250.000 patients die from such infections in the US and EU every year. So it is quite a severe problem and robots can help solve it. More generally, robots are part of the solution to overcome shortage of labour and increase the quality of various processes at the hospital.  "
"The UVD Robot 3G, also known as the UVD Disinfection Robot, is the world’s most advanced UV robot to date. It recently won a Good Design 2021 Award. What was the team’s initial reaction when they heard this news? "
"Our team is always super-excited when we win an award and this was also the case for the Good Design 2021 Award. In fact, we have won more than 25 international awards for our robots over the past three to four years and we are all proud of this. The only thing that outcompetes these awards is the positive feedback we receive every day from patients, hospital staff and users of the robots. "
The fact that our robots save lives every day and make life so much easier for so many people is really motivating for the Blue Ocean Robotics team.  
"But your work isn’t limited to the medical sphere. Blue Ocean Robotics has been lending its expertise to, and creating services for, the hospitality, construction, and agriculture industries, as well. Can you elaborate on this more? "
"Our biggest market by far is healthcare and, in particular, hospitals. But the service robots we make can deliver automated services to other industries as well. UVD Robots, for example, are also widely used in the pharma industry to reduce the level of pathogens in certain parts of the environment at a pharmaceutical production facility.  "
Blue Ocean Robotics is also nominated for numerous awards at the Green Product Award 2022 and BOLD Award. How does it feel knowing that the good your work does is being recognised? We are super-excited about this and very humble as well. We are just proud of and very satisfied with the fact that our robots are doing good things for people all over the world. 
"As CEO of one of the world’s most successful robotics companies, Mr Risager, what keeps you awake at night? During the last year or so, the shortage of components has also led to reduced quality of these components. While this is a global phenomenon, it has in some cases given us problems that ended up with malfunctioning robots. "
"And some of these were not caught by our extensive testing procedures and therefore these robots ended up with some of the customers. In these cases, I have been very emotionally affected, because it means everything to me and to the company to deliver the best-quality robots in the world and to deliver high value to our customers. Experiencing disappointed customers due to technical issues can keep me awake at night until we have solved these problems again.  "
"In our previous interview, when asked how you defined success, you stated “customers clearly stating that our robots give value to them”. Is this still your definition today? Absolutely. We are obsessed with our customers and the success and value our robots bring to them. "
For more than 30 years Claus Risager has been working with robot technology and has with his establishment of Blue Ocean Robotics created a company that focuses on developing robot technology with the purpose to help solve some of the biggest challenges in our society. Claus Risager is former center manager of the Danish Technological Institute’s Center for Robot Technology with a Ph.D. in Robotics & Artificial Intelligence.
"Cybersecurity Made Simple: Taming the Password.Interview with Michael Crandell, CEO of Bitwarden"
"In the old days, all we had to memorise was a birthday or two. Now, the internet and all its security ramifications oblige us to grapple with a seemingly infinite list of passwords, in both our professional and our private, lives. But, as Michael Crandell, CEO of Bitwarden, tells us, it doesn’t have to be so hard."
"Good day, Mr Crandell! Can we start with a few words on what made you want to work in cybersecurity?"
"My interest in security began with encryption, when I was implementing encryption technology as part of a document storage system. The idea that I could make a document inaccessible to anyone – including the system in which it was stored – and then return it to readable form for verified users, was exciting. I realised then the tremendous potential for achieving security through a multi-layered approach."
Was there something in particular about information security that drew you in?
"As former New York Times cybersecurity reporter and author Nicole Perlroth said during the recent Bitwarden Open Source Security Summit, the fight against global cyberattacks isn’t just the responsibility of governments; businesses and individuals all play critical roles. What inspires me is the opportunity every day to help businesses solve their password security challenges, to help individuals stay safe online, and to work with a talented team that is passionate about those same goals."
"Launched in 2015, Bitwarden has consistently provided the global community of online users with a way to securely manage their sensitive information and promote overall good credential hygiene. What moved you to finally establish your company?"
"The founder and CTO of Bitwarden is Kyle Spearrin. He recognised the need for a more comprehensive password management product that could meet the needs of end users and businesses. As an open source solution, Bitwarden views trust and transparency differently from competitors. We host our source code publicly on Github, which means anyone is free to audit and contribute to the codebase. "
"Community, accountability, and code quality are key differentiators of the open source approach we take at Bitwarden."
"For companies looking to establish a solid cybersecurity posture today, what common problems might they run into and how would you advise them to deal with them?"
"Our common challenge is also our great opportunity – namely, to empower employees to improve their personal security practices. Improving corporate security starts at the personal level, where employees are not only educated and aware of best practices, but also have the necessary tools to follow similar practices in their personal and home lives. "
"When security tools are complex and difficult to use, adoption is going to be slow for your company. If you educate your employees about password management and multi-factor authentication and give them tools that improve their workflows and daily lives in and outside of work, you’ll see much less resistance. Think of it as helping people do business faster, safely."
"In a survey conducted by your company, it was found that 92 percent of IT decision-makers reported reusing passwords across multiple sites. Aside from the tediousness of having to remember multiple passwords, why do you think even industry leaders struggle with implementing a password security scheme?"
"People hate passwords, but they love their password managers. Until you use a password manager daily, you don’t even realise how much time you have spent unnecessarily trying to keep track of everything."
"It’s simple. People hate passwords, but they love their password managers. Until you use a password manager daily, you don’t even realise how much time you have spent unnecessarily trying to keep track of everything. I think people have good intentions; it’s a case of “the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  Once they’ve had the “Aha!” moment of using a password manager, they’re on board."
"Unfortunately, not every company provides password managers to all of their employees. So employees revert to do-it-yourself practices, which involves reusing passwords and creating simple passwords. However, things are changing as companies realise they can have happy and secure employees when they provide them with convenient tools for managing secure credentials. "
"You’re the CEO of Bitwarden, working in the realm of internet security. Have you ever fallen victim to an online scam?"
"Thankfully, I have not been scammed, but a few years ago I was notified that LinkedIn had been hacked and my email and password were exposed. My initial concern was not about my LinkedIn account being compromised, but whether this log-in and password that had been exposed were also used for any of my bank accounts. "
"Since I was using a password manager at the time, I had strong and unique passwords set up for every site, and I realized the only thing I had to do to re-secure my account was update my LinkedIn password and the problem was solved. I know at Bitwarden we provide that same protection for millions of users every day."
"In your opinion, what exactly is so bad about passwords?I wouldn’t claim that passwords are bad. Passwords have been around since ancient times and will continue to be a part of our daily lives both personally and professionally. Passwords are ingrained in all of us; people know how to use them and, as long as they are strong and unique, they do their job."
"It’s how we interact with and manage passwords that needs improvement. Businesses and individuals today use hundreds of online accounts and applications that require passwords for access. To deal with this, people tend to use the same password for multiple accounts. When a weak password has been compromised, it compromises all other accounts that use the same password. For businesses, the ramifications of a leaked password are often disastrous. "
The SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline incidents are a couple examples out of many.Passwords by themselves are not bad. When they are improperly managed – that’s what’s bad.
In what way can Bitwarden help with an organisation’s data protection and cybersecurity? What needs to be done by companies and organisations to avoid data breaches?
"Every company is different and security systems should be tailored to the company’s size, structure, existing tools and resources. Cybercriminals can come through various vectors across the organisation. Just like you wouldn’t lock your windows but keep your front door open, companies need a multi-layered approach to security.The easiest way to mitigate data breaches is to use strong and unique passwords for every account and service. "
"What isn’t so easy is that, for most people, remembering these passwords is impossible. Enter Bitwarden. Most simply, Bitwarden provides a way for people to create, securely store and easily access their passwords anywhere they need them. But that’s just the beginning. For companies that are scaling, they need an easy way to manage secure password storage and sharing across multiple teams and functions."
"So, the simplest first step toward cybersecurity and data protection is to start with the one thing every employee uses daily: their passwords. Giving employees a password management tool that simplifies their workflows is mutually beneficial for them and their companies. Employees will want to use Bitwarden, and IT teams will have better password security control."
Can you highlight a few core features of password management systems and their benefits to teams who mainly work remotely? Password management systems should: Offer to store existing passwords in a secure vault automatically when a user is accessing a new website. Generate strong passwords for new accounts when they are created by the user. Autofill username and password credentials when the user visits a website already stored in their vault.
"Allow users to work across multiple operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile devices (Android, Apple iOS), browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera), and a web vault."
"For remote teams, a few of our top Enterprise features include: Organisations allow teams to collaborate or share portions of a business vault. When you create an organisation within a vault, you can then associate users and vault items together to share log-ins, notes, cards and identities that are owned by the organisation, which can be a team, business, family or any group that needs to securely share data. "
"SSO integration. Bitwarden offers multiple authentication options with zero-knowledge encryption and delivers the right configuration for each company’s SSO requirements.Event and audit logs. This provides a record of events, activities and changes that occur across your company’s system operations. It’s an incredibly valuable resource for IT teams, admins and auditors who want to examine potentially suspicious activities on a network, or troubleshoot issues. "
"Free Families plan for employees. Bitwarden recently announced that customers on the Enterprise plan can offer their employees a personal Bitwarden Families plan, including five additional accounts for their loved ones. A comprehensive list of Bitwarden Enterprise features can be found at bitwarden.com. "
"You’ve also mentioned that despite the common knowledge that using unsafe sharing methods can lead to a cyberattack, people still continue to engage in risky credential practices. How would you encourage them to be more security-conscious?"
"At Bitwarden, we recommend a simple concept called “the triangle of security success”. It’s three simple steps: Start using a password manager. Bitwarden offers a fully featured free version, so anyone should be able to get started with little fuss.  "
"Secure your email account. It’s more than a digital mailbox in which you receive messages. It’s often the way websites verify who you are by sending a confirmation email, so you’ll want to add some additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication. "
"Keep going and implement two-factor authentication everywhere you can, starting with your password manager and email system. This adds another layer of security in the form of an additional log-in step, over and above your password. "
"On that same note, why do you think password security is such a polarising topic within the crypto community in particular?"
"Actually, it appears to us that there is a lot of communal rallying around increased attention to credentials within the crypto community. Most people recognise that it is nearly impossible to keep track of cryptocurrency credentials without the help of a password manager. And with cryptocurrency and web3 trends putting more responsibility and emphasis on decentralisation and end-user control, password security practices become even more important. "
"There are always a few open debates as to whether you should store your seed phrases in a password manager, but that is really up to individuals and their unique security profiles. Overall, we see the push to crypto currency and the emphasis on end-user credential management as just another reason folks need a password manager. "
How would you advise companies to promote a stronger security culture?
"Build consistency. Education and awareness are key but it’s not enough to offer one employee training session and think the lesson will sink in. Security is a process – we have to learn good security habits over time, just like we learn healthy habits over time, such as going to the gym or eating healthily. It doesn’t happen overnight. The threat landscape is always changing and how you build a security-conscious culture will need to keep pace. "
"Establish open dialogue. In addition to regular security awareness training, make it OK for employees to ask questions or report security incidents. Sometimes, people are embarrassed if they accidentally clicked on a phishing email or downloaded a malicious link. Sometimes, they’re worried about repercussions. Sometimes, they simply don’t know. Give them a safe and open forum – we’re all in this together – and tell people: “If you see something, say something.” "
"Bestow responsibility on all. Online security isn’t merely IT’s job. Cybercriminals exploit human weaknesses and most attacks are said to rely in some part on human involvement. Giving your employees security tools is good, but giving them accessible tools that boost security without slowing down productivity – such as a password manager – is even better.  "
"When do you think we’ll see a ‘password-less future’ and how much of a challenge will it be adapting to that future?Unlike other password managers, the Bitwarden name intentionally does not include the word password in order to reflect the broader vision of creating more secure online experiences for everyone. Bitwarden currently integrates passwordless approaches, including biometrics, security keys, and single sign-on."
"Bitwarden enterprise customers deploy passwordless technologies in phases, based on various factors such as size, departmental needs, IT resources, employee personas, and more."
"The passwordless future is here today. But the pace at which individuals and businesses adopt new forms of authentication will continue to evolve over time. Bitwarden enterprise customers deploy passwordless technologies in phases, based on various factors such as size, departmental needs, IT resources, employee personas, and more."
" These factors shape how quickly customers can transition into other forms of authentication. Many of our customers start the passwordless journey by integrating applications with single sign-on systems and identity providers, based on tokens or other passwordless entry points.  "
"As Wired’s “best choice” password manager, how can Bitwarden secure the “virtual front door” for good?Many data breaches start through the same attack vector: account compromise through weak passwords. This is true even for large enterprises with advanced security controls in place, simply because we’re human. We’re all susceptible to clicking on phishing links in emails, downloading malicious attachments, or unintentionally visiting malicious websites.   "
"Bitwarden helps enterprises on several levels:  For IT admins and anyone in charge of cybersecurity, Bitwarden provides them with granular access control and user management to configure and optimise overall security. For employees and end users, Bitwarden offers an easy way for them to generate, store and secure complex passwords. This can go a long way toward ensuring that all work-related accounts and services have strong passwords.  "
"For executive and leadership teams, Bitwarden takes you one step closer to building a security-conscious culture across your entire company, where everyone embraces the role they play in cybersecurity. When you give employees accessible security tools that make their lives easier, it’s that much easier to ingrain a sense of accountability and ownership."

"Outsourcing That Puts People First.Interview with Rajnish Sinha, CPO at outsourcing provider TaskUs."
"Traditionally, the welfare of a company’s employees lies within its own control. But what if that same company opts to outsource? Who looks after employee well-being then? Clearly, the working environment and employment policies of the outsourcing provider are key. Rajnish Sinha, CPO at outsourcing provider TaskUs, outlines his company’s approach. "
"Good day, Mr. Sinha! Thank you for giving us your time today. Could we begin with a few words on how you got started in your career in human resources?"
"Thank you for this opportunity. HR was actually my backup plan, not my first love; business operations was my sole focus. I was a Business major, but liked the people and business combination and went to the best HR school in India: XLRI Jamshedpur. I started my career in consumer goods and then spent a lot of time in tech and consulting, mostly with Genpact, a GE spin-off. I have really loved the opportunity of driving impact on people across my tenure in the function."
"What do you find most intriguing about human resources?I’ve always found building human connections to be very important, and particularly in my role as Chief People Officer of a global company, I find bridging cultures and forging connections across the world particularly intriguing.Working with global talent excites me. Being in a growth industry, we are able to provide opportunities to many people all across the world. "
"Founded in 2008, TaskUs has been hard at work for decades delivering “ridiculously good next-generation digital outsourcing” for everyone from new-age disruptors to established icons. What’s the most exciting part of the job for you?TaskUs gets to work with some of the most disruptive, established brands in the world—as well as some of the most exciting up-and-coming businesses. It is an amazing opportunity to provide ridiculously great solutions to the world’s most innovative brands. "
"But the real joy is working with refreshingly smart, creative, and transparent individuals. It is exciting to help produce the best working experience for our people to enjoy their work and soon create world-changing businesses for the brands we partner with. We all share the success as one of our Core Values is TWMTDW (Teamwork Makes the Dream Work). That’s one of our mantras."
"Since its humble beginnings in a small space above an auto shop, TaskUs has grown exponentially and received numerous awards including CCW’s “2021 BPO of the Year” and Recruitment Hacker’s “2021 Best Localization Champion.” How do you think the company’s culture has played a role in its success?"
"Our company culture is a direct reflection of our people. And it all starts with our leadership. Co-founders Bryce Maddock and Jaspar Weir have always been steadfast in creating a company that they truly believe in, embodying a dynamic culture that puts people at the heart of TaskUs. Their unique vision for a people-first company has led to consistent growth, even during a global pandemic. "
"We know that investing in employee experience helps us keep our employees happy. We believe that, happy employees equate to happy clients. "
"Our employees are members of a closely integrated team that our clients can see and trust. I believe TaskUs has so far demonstrated a strong commitment to building a supportive workplace for all our teammates, increasing business transparency, and creating genuine partnerships with our clients. Apart from that, we are dedicated to making a positive impact on the world around"
TaskUs has also been a consistent recipient of the “Best Company for Women” and “Best Company for Diversity” awards for many years now. What do you suggest to companies looking to be more inclusive?
"For companies who want to be more inclusive, I recommend not only talking the talk, but walking the walk. At TaskUs, we’re proud to cultivate a safe, inclusive, and equitable environment that empowers every person to collaborate and thrive together regardless of age, gender, race, culture, and background. We’ve built a culture where everyone is committed to creating a positive environment and establishing a space where every employee feels included and supported. "
"We’ve built gender parity into our workforce and leadership team. We advocate for our teammates and their communities. We also created spaces for all of our teammates to voice concerns and share ideas for continuous improvement because we know the work of building a truly inclusive, welcoming space is never completely done."
"Diversity, equity, and inclusion also start from Day 1 at TaskUs. As an equal-opportunity employer, we are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees. When it comes to hiring, we believe that the more diverse the workforce is, the better. "
"What do you find most challenging about leading people operations for a team of overnearly 40,000 people? What is most rewarding?The most challenging thing is also the most rewarding! As of December last year, our team is located across 23 locations in 10 different countries. We have such a large and diverse workforce, so working with TaskUs means having the opportunity to establish cohesive yet unique corporate norms across our global locations."
"Leading this large team, especially during COVID, has been a bit difficult to have face-to-face interactions and have deeper insight into our employees’ lives, but it has also provided us with an opportunity to explore more hybrid and remote tools and roles. "
How would you suggest that business leaders maximize employee engagement and retention?We’re proud to have a workplace culture that genuinely prioritizes employee wellbeing and engagement. I strongly believe recognizing employee battles inside and outside their professional life is the first step to a healthy and well-rounded workforce. 
"Over the past year, TaskUs doubled the number of life coaches and mental health professionals available to our employees. Our Wellness and Resiliency department also served as a critical lifeline for many employees as we shifted our global workforce to work-from-home early on in the pandemic. "
"Additionally, we encourage learning through experience with initiatives like the IdeaUs portal, which empowers our employees to share new business solutions and ideas to address current roadblocks in customer support. Instead of taking direction from leadership, the IdeaUs portal allows solutions to flow upward."
"Given the success of our people-first program at TaskUs, I think companies today definitely need to take employee feedback more seriously, prioritize high-quality mental health support and resources, and encourage learning through social experience."
"Being a people-first company, investing in employee well-being is a winning proposition. It leads not just to higher employee engagement, but also productivity and improved morale. Although beyond offering services to employees, it all comes down to embedding a wellness mindset into the company culture and having leaders lead by example. "
Your company places great emphasis on prioritizing your people and building a strong culture across global offices. Can you elaborate on what this means in practice and how it impacts your work for your clients?
"TaskUs is a launchpad for disruptors to achieve growth and global scale, and employee experience is key to our success. We directly invest in our own people by bolstering valuable tools, technology, resources, and training programs solely dedicated to upskilling our workforce. "
"With over 40,000 employees scattered across 10 different countries, TaskUs has an incredibly international, culturally diverse workforce. We place great emphasis on building a strong people-first culture because it’s what unites us. As a global organization with offices around the world, we want to ensure that we are leveraging every opportunity to enhance our employee morale."
Mental health and wellness are also a primary focus for the TaskUs people team. Why should businesses prioritize devoting resources to ensure the wellbeing of their teams?
"Wellness and Resiliency programming has become a significant differentiator for TaskUs. Simply put, it’s the right thing to do. But to make a business case, while there is a cost to making these resources and benefits available for team members, there is also a cost to not offering them. "
"Doing nothing to invest in the wellbeing of team members results in rises in benefits claims regarding mental and physical wellness needs, increases in absenteeism, decreases in productivity, and lower employee satisfaction which can lead to burnout and attrition. Being proactive and making resources available to support team members is a clear choice."
"Our clients are receptive and ready to invest because we are able to show proof of the benefits through measurable data and outcomes. They’ve also shown an increased trust, which allows for more autonomy in our working relationships."
"TaskUs recently expanded further in Europe with new offices in Greece, Poland, and Romania. How have you scaled your company’s culture to these new cities?"
"As a people-first company, we always take into consideration the needs of our people in all our geos. We have quarterly eSAT surveys to assess this. We deep dive into the responses in this survey to understand how we can further improve our initiatives and benefits for our employees.We also try to instill our Core Values from day 1. We constantly talk about them, and recognize people who live these values inside and outside of work."
"Employee benefits and programs are a big part of the TaskUs culture and overall employee experience. As we do with every new site, we look at the specific needs and maximize the benefits for team members at that site. For example, in Greece, we’ve ensured that every teammate is automatically enrolled in a free insurance, medical, and disability expenses plan, and is eligible to enroll an unlimited number of immediate family members. "
"For Ireland, we have a unique gym reimbursement program as we firmly believe in a physically and mentally healthy workforce. We also provide a bike-to-work scheme wherein our teammates can avail government tax relief offering tax-free bikes for cycling to work."
"Apart from those geo-specific benefits, we also have our global initiatives for all our teammates to enjoy. We offer free mental health consultations to our employees and their dependents. TaskUs also believes in giving ample career and professional development opportunities for all employees."
"Apart from our in-house upskilling and skills certification programs, we also have a Tuition Fee Reimbursement Program that covers a portion of the cost for furthering education toward an Associate, Bachelor, Master, or Doctoral degree, or approved certification program."
Many people would agree that the team is the backbone of any service business. And it’s even more important in terms of engineering expertise and the ability to deliver technological products. What’s your approach to building and evolving the team?
"We know that in today’s working landscape, it’s as much of an interview for a prospective employee to get to know us as it is for us to get to know them. So, we’ve taken strides to make our hiring process the best in the business, to put our best foot forward, and show what our culture of respect is all about in the first impression. This helps make us a desired place to work for ridiculously talented candidates. "
"We also provide exceptional training for each team member and ensure they are not only valued members of the TaskUs team, but also our partner companies’ teams. "
"In a post-pandemic world, what issues might a company need to take into account when considering outsourcing?We’ve all learned in the last two years that work is not the most important thing. So, as companies think about the work they want to accomplish and decide whether outsourcing is right for them, those companies should first prioritize the people who will be doing the work before the work itself. "
They should ensure that any outsourcing partner also aligns with this priority and provides a working experience for team members that respects work-life balance and provides fair and equitable compensation and benefits.
The world of work has changed so much just in the last two years. What further changes do you predict for the future of the workplace?
"Predictions can be tricky because none of us expected a global pandemic over two years ago, and we can never really know for sure what the future will hold. What we have found, though, is that flexibility is the most important attribute of a successful business in times of uncertainty and change. "
"I think that flexibility will continue to define the future of work—flexible schedules, flexible workspaces, flexible locations, and flexible leadership that can adapt to what its people need, not expect people to adapt to a company’s rigid ways."
